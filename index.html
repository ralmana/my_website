        <h1>My Life</h1>

        <p>Hello reader! You are reading about my life through a special coding launguage called html! My name is Rakan Almana and I am 15 Years old. My favorite subjects are Math and Science, and I really enjoy them, because I understand them. Something I love doing out of school is Running, and I am on the Track and Field Team at ACS! I love ACS and this is my 12th year in this school, and I have seen many changes and many people come in and out of the doors of ACS.  </p>
